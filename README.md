Icy Tower Once More  
by vamastah

### description
**ictoonmo** is inspired by Icy Tower, a freeware platform game by Free Lunch Design. It is set in a simplistic tower, where the player's goal is to jump from one "floor" to the next and go as high as possible without falling and plunging off the screen. It has been developed with handheld consoles in mind, but can run on desktop computers as well.
